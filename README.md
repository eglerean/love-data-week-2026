## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This website is built with Jekyll, which requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org). 

1. **Check if Ruby is installed:**
   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```

2. **Install Ruby (if needed):**
   - **macOS (Apple Silicon M1/M2/M3):** Use Homebrew
     ```bash
     brew install ruby
     export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"  # Add to ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - **macOS (Intel):** 
     ```bash
     brew install ruby
     export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"  # Add to ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - **Linux:** Follow the [Ruby installation docs](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
   - **Windows:** Install [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) or use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dinhe878/love-data-week-2026.git
   cd love-data-week-2026
   ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment (optional, for data-related scripts):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Bundler:**
   ```bash
   gem install bundler
   ```

4. **Install Jekyll and dependencies:**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
   
   If you encounter permission errors, delete the lockfile and regenerate it:
   ```bash
   rm Gemfile.lock
   bundle install
   ```

5. **Run the local development server:**
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```
   
   Then visit: [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000)

6. **Auto-reload on config changes:**
   If you modify `_config.yml`, you'll need to restart the server (Ctrl+C, then re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve`). For automatic reloading, install guard:
   ```bash
   bundle add guard guard-jekyll-plus
   bundle exec guard init jekyll
   bundle exec guard
   ```

## Editing the Website

### Adding Team Members

Edit the `team` list in `_config.yml`:

    image: /assets/member-photo.jpg
    affiliation: University Name
    title: Position/Role
    links:
      - title: Website

```

Team members are automatically displayed on the `about.md` page.

### Adding Navigation Pages

1. Create a new Markdown file in the repository root
2. Add front matter with `menu_title` and `menu_icon` (Bootstrap Icons):
   ```markdown

   title: Page Title
   menu_title: Nav Label
   menu_icon: icon-name
   ---
   ```
3. Add the filename to `header_pages` in `_config.yml`

### Useful Liquid Tags

- **Reference config variables:** `{{ site.event_date }}`
- **Link to pages:** `[Link text]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link page-name.md %})`
- **Loop through team members:** 
  ```liquid
  {% for member in site.team %}
    {{ member.name }} - {{ member.affiliation }}
  {% endfor %}
  ```
