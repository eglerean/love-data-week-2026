    <h2>A theme to reflect: <strong>"Where's the Data?"</strong></h2>
    <p>A playful nudge to get everyone thinking about the journey our research data takes — from planning and collection to storage, documentation, and long‑term preservation.</p>
    <p>On Thursday 12 February 2026, we invite research groups across the Nordics to join a shared moment of reflection, cleanup, and improvement.  
Think of it as a spring‑cleaning day… but for <strong>your data</strong>.</p>
    <p>Although it works great if you do activities as a group, you could also just (re)think about your data management strategies on how to make data more findable!</p>

## Why join?

- Time for your group to benefit from creating a data management plan template, so <strong>all group member can finally know where to find the data?</strong>
- Improve reproducibility practices by start <strong>strategizing data storage location and duration</strong>.
- Finally document the workflow so that not just creator understands, <strong>before creator forgot where is the workflow</strong>.
- Ready to start publishing datasets alongside your scientific articles? Hmm...but <strong>where should I publish my datasets?</strong>

Whatever your situation, this is your moment to pause, breathe, and give your data the love it deserves — together with colleagues across the Nordic region.
